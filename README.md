# Dimnmable light switch

This repository contains a simple example of a dimmable light switch. The example is very basic, since it is used for teaching purposes by the Software Engineering Lab of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Mons.

The aim of the example is to illustrate how to implement a visual UI controlled by a statechart,
based on a state design pattern in object-oriented style. The example also illustrates how to write unit tests for testing the behaviour of this statechart.

The example is implemented in **TypeScript**, and has a visual frontend in **VueJS**.
The example can be built with Vite, and tested with **Vitest**.
